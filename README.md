# Folder Synchronization

In this repository, you will find my solution for the test provided. I chose to solve the test in Python and every library I used is part of Python's standard library so you won't need to install any new packages.

## Usage

Simply run the following command in your terminal to get the script running properly.

```
python sync_folders.py <source_folder> <replica_folder> <interval_in_seconds> <log_file_path>
```
